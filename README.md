# djangazzo
Django docker compose for fast developing without ops overhead.

#Dev Env with docker-compose

BE CAREFUL! BEFORE DOCKER-COMPOSE UP BE SURE TO HAVE ALL DJANGO STARTFILES!

like manage.py, settings and so on, well configured.

## docker-compose

First time we need to build the stack

```console
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml up --build
```

After that, next time we can run our docker env

```console
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml up [-d to detach]
```

Execute management command inside docker-compose

```console
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py makemigrations
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py startapp myamazingapp
```

This files are created by django inside docker so it's owned by root
tune the permission to solve the issue

```console
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$USER .
```

now we can open the browser to http://localhost:8000 and profit.

## DJANGO OPERATIONS

When too much error block console and need to check where problem is
```console
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py check
```

When you need to collectstatic for prod env
```console
docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py collectstatic
```

Launch tests
```console
docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py test -k
```

Launch django shell
```console
docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py shell
```

Dumpdata/Fixtures for all project
```console
docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py dumpdata --format json --indent 4
```

**BE CAREFUL WHEN DUMPDATA FROM DOCKER ENV: CHECK IF SOME LOG STRING IS ON TOP OF JSON DUMP**

Dumpdata/Fixture for a single app of the project
```console
docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py dumpdata appname --format json --indent 4 > app/fixtures/dump.json
```

Loaddata from fixtures after new db initialization
```console
docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py loaddata app/fixtures/dump.json
```

## DJANGO TRANSLATIONS AND MULTILANGUAGE SUPPORT
To generate TRANSLATION, first of all create .po files with
```console
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py makemessages -i venv -l it
```

after the translation, compile them with

```console
$ docker-compose -f local-dev.yml run --rm django python manage.py compilemessages --exclude venv/
```

# POSTGRESQL

postgres on his docker, composed with python django docker expose a port
To connect to use psql installed locally [or a docker client if prefer]

```console
$ psql -U postgres -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5432
```

# MAILHOG

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. For that reason local SMTP server MailogH with a web interface is available as docker container.

Container mailhog will start automatically when you will run all docker containers.

With [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) running, to view messages that are sent by your application, open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8025
